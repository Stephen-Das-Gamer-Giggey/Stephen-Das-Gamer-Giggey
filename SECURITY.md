## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report vulnerabilities with the project, please reach out via email to dasgamerislife1@yahoo.com and the team will address the vulnerabilities mentioned with the project. If that method is unsuccessful, please call 208-597-5445 and inform me of the vulnerabilities within the project itself and the team will do their best to address any issues.
If the vulnerabilities are accepted, the project may become temporarily locked so the issue(s) can be addressed. As with all game projects, there will be some bugs or glitches that may need to be addressed later. If a reported vulnerability is declined, that may be an indication that the team is working to address the vulnerability and has knowledge of the vulnerability, at which time they will attempt to fix any issues and reduce the amount of vulnerabilities present.
